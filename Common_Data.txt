@Gertrud29409036 @BradWall306 Alberta has one of the youngest populations in the country stupid. What you fail to realize is Kenney is attacking the future prosperity of Albertans by stealing future pensions today. Don't expect the rest of Canada to keep bailing you out and saving you from yourselves.
@RHDefence There is truly no excuse for the economic circumstances to which Canada (&amp; many others) are subjecting their youth. But it's important to put responsibility where it belongs, lest the wrong people be punished - which would cause pain yet fail to alleviate the problem.

I hope that Halifax NS City Council devises a plan to ban bicycles from city streets and builds them some bicycle paths throughout the city. They are a hazard to themselves and others lives. Three times had bikes fall over and scratched my car. One passed me @ every intersection
